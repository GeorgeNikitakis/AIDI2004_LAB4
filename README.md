Fish Classification using Random Forest  
## Description  
This ML model uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict the type of Fish based on inputs: Weight, Length1(vertical), Length2(diagonal), Length3(cross), Height, and Width. The Fish Market dataset from Kaggle was used to train and test the model. (All measurements are recorded in cm).  
## How to install  
To install make sure that all the packages listed in the "requirements.txt" file have been installed and are of the specified versions or higher.  
## How to use  
To run this model in your local machine make sure all files are located in the same folder and then run the "FlaskApp.py" file. Copy and paste ('crtl/cmd' + 'click') the local host URL into your web browser.  
To predict fish type, you must enter the fish measurements(cm) into all fields. Then click on the "predict" button bellow to get prediction.
